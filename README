This software creates a joystick device on Linux, whose positions are
derived from a PPM (pulse-position modulation) signal with 6 channels on
the default ALSA device on Linux. It is recommended to run `jscal' to
calibrate the resulting device. The program needs permission to read
from the ALSA device, and to create uinput devices.

On my system, it creates a device at /dev/input/js0.
