You need the libasound2 library and include files, as well as gcc. To
compile the program, run `make'. ppm needs write access to /dev/uinput
to create the joystick device. The easiest way to accomplish this is to
make ppm suid root, i.e. `chown root ppm; chmod 1755 ppm' (as root). Of
course, this isn't a terribly good idea, but I haven't attempted to
improve the situation.
